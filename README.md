# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine whether it is feasable to use neural networks to train data from simple wearable sensors to predict what activities are being performed by the wearer. For example, this may include classifying the level of physical exertion. It could also include predicting what specific activity is being done (ie basketball, running, weight lifting, etc.)

# Stakeholder Questions and Answers
Here are specific questions and answers that should be provided to stakeholders, based on experimenting with publicly available data:
1. Is this feasable?
    - It is feasable to use heart rate detection to define the activity level of the user. This does not require machine learning modeling because it can be done with simple computations. According to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-intensity/art-20046887), moderate exercise intensity is about 50% to 70% of maximum heart rate. Vigorous exercise intensity is about 70% to 85% of maximum heart rate. The maximum heart rate differs by age, but can be found at the [Cleveland Clinic's](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exercise-heart-rate-zones-explained/) website.

2. What sorts of activities can it detect and why?
3. What is the best model for this problem? Do neural networks work the best? What defines the best model?
4. How much compute power is necessary to make predictions with this model?
