The purpose of this project is to determine whether it is feasable to use neural networks to train data from simple wearable sensors to predict what activities are being performed by the wearer. For example, this may include classifying the level of physical exertion. It could also include predicting what specific activity is being done (ie basketball, running, weight lifting, etc.)

Here are specific questions that should be provided to stakeholders, based on experimenting with publicly available data:
    1. Is this feasable?
    2. What sorts of activities can it detect and why?
    3. What is the best model for this problem? Do neural networks work
       the best? What defines the best model?
    4. How much compute power is necessary to make predictions with
       this model?
